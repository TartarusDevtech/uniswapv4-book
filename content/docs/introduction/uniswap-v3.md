# Introduction to Uniswap V3

> This chapter retells [the whitepaper of Uniswap V3](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf). Again, it's totally ok if
you don't understand all the concepts. They will be clearer when converted to code.

To better understand the innovations Uniswap V3 brings, let's first look at the imperfections of Uniswap V2.

Uniswap V2 is a general exchange that implements one AMM algorithm. However, not all trading pairs are equal. We can group
pairs by price volatility:

1. Pairs with medium and high volatility. This group includes most of the tokens since most tokens don't have their
prices pegged to something and are subject to market fluctuations.
1. Pairs with low volatility. This group includes pegged tokens, mainly stablecoins: USDC-USDT, USDC-DAI, USDT-DAI, etc.
Also: ETH-stETH, ETH-rETH.

These groups require different, let's call them, pool configurations. The main difference is that pegged tokens require
high liquidity to reduce the demand effect (we learned about it in the previous chapter) on big trades. The prices of
USDC and USDT must stay close to 1, no matter how big the number of tokens we want to buy and sell.

Another imperfection of Uniswap V2 is that liquidity in a pool is distributed infinitely. Liquidity is provided at any
price from 0 to infinity:

[TODO: add illustration]

This might not seem like a bad thing, but this reduces *capital efficiency*. Historical prices of an asset stay within
some defined range, whether it's narrow or wide. For example, the historical price range of ETH is from <span>$0.75</span>
to <span>$4,800</span> (according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)). Today (June 2022,
 1 ETH costs <span>$1,1800</span>), no one will buy 1 ether for <span>$5000</span> so it makes no sense to provide
 liquidity at this price. Thus, a lot of liquidity in a V2 pool cannot and won't be used, ever. And this can be improved.

## Concentrated Liquidity

Uniswap V3 introduces the idea of *concentrated liquidity*. Liquidity providers can now choose the price range they want
to provide liquidity into. This improves capital efficiency by allowing to put more liquidity into a narrow price range,
which makes Uniswap more diverse: it can now have pools configured specifically for medium-to-high volatility pairs or
low-volatility pairs. This fixes the problem of Uniswap V2 we discussed above. However, this feature doesn't come without
drawbacks: it's now possible that the global price of an asset moves rapidly to a range V3 pools have no liquidity in.

[TODO: add illustration, compare liquidity distributions]

Implementing concentrated liquidity requires slightly different mathematics. Uniswap V3 introduces two new mathematical
concepts, which are based on the math concepts of V2: liquidity $L$ and square root of price $\sqrt{P}$.

 Pool contracts no longer track pool reserves, $x$ and $y$. Instead, they track liquidity:

$$L = \sqrt{xy}$$

And square root of price:
$$\sqrt{P} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}$$

$L$ is the geometric mean of reserves, you can think of it as *a unit of liquidity*.

> In the previous chapter, we figured out that the trade function can be rewritten as a comparison of geometric means of
reserves before and after a swap.

$P$ is the price of token X in terms of token Y, and $\sqrt{P}$ is the square root of this price. The reasons of using
the square root are:
1. Square root calculation is tricky and expensive in terms of gas consumption. Thus, it's easier to store the square root
without calculating it in the contracts.
1. $\sqrt{P}$ has an interesting connection to $L$: $L$ is also the relation between the change in output amount and $\sqrt{P}$.

    $$L = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta\sqrt{P}}$$

    [TODO: prove this]



## Pricing

To calculate prices (or trade amounts) we need to know pool reserves $x$ and $y$. And we can find them from $L$ and
$\sqrt{P}$:

$$x = \frac{L}{\sqrt{P}}$$
$$y = L \sqrt{P}$$

[TODO: prove this]

However, we'll never need to do this because $L$ and $\sqrt{P}$ allow us to find trade amounts without knowing
$x$ and $y$. Let's return to this formula:

$$L = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta\sqrt{P}}$$

We can find $\Delta y$ from it:

$$\Delta y = L \Delta \sqrt{P}$$

As we discussed above, prices in a pool are reciprocals of each other. Since $\frac{y}{x}$ is the price of $x$ in terms
of $y$, then $\frac{x}{y}$ (or $\frac{1}{y/x}$) is the other way around. Next, if $\sqrt{P} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}$, then
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{y/x}}$, then $\frac{1}{\sqrt{P}}$ is the square root of the price of $y$ in terms
of $x$ (reciprocal of $\sqrt{P}$). Knowing this, we can express $L$ in terms of $\Delta x$:

$$L = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}}}$$

And, finally:

$$\Delta x = \Delta \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} L$$

This means that we don't need to store reserves in the contract, we don't need to calculate them, and we also don't need
to calculate $\sqrt{P}$ each time. To calculate output amount we need to know input amount (trader chooses it) and $L$
(calculated based on liquidity in a pool). To calculate input amount we need to know output amount (trader chooses it)
and $L$. In both cases, we first need to calculate $\Delta \sqrt{P}$ or $\Delta \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}}$.

[TODO: clean up, make the connection between the formulas clearer.]

## Ticks

Custom liquidity ranges are implemented through *ticks*â€“the range of all possible prices is demarcated by ticks and
liquidity is provided between two ticks chosen by a liquidity provider. 

[TODO: add illustration]

Each tick is mapped to some price from the range of all available prices. This mapping is done through this formula:

$$p(i) = 1.00001^i$$

Where $p(i)$ is the price at tick $i$. This formula is then improved to use $\sqrt{p}$ for the reasons explained above:

$$ \sqrt{p(i)} = \sqrt{1.0001}^i = 1.0001^{\frac{i}{2}}$$

$1.0001^i$ was chosen because it makes adjacent ticks 0.01% away from each other. **The difference in price between
two adjacent ticks is 0.01%**, or *1 basis point*.

> Basis point (1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001) is a unit of measure of percentages in finance. You could heard about
basis point when central banks announced changes in interest rates.

This seemingly tricky algorithm allows to demarcate the continuous range of prices into evenly
distributed prices indexed by ticks, where the distance between two prices/ticks is always 0.01%. This is a powerful
design. If it's hard to understand now, it'll become clearer after we implemented it.
